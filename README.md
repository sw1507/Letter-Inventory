# Letter-Inventory

Implementation Details
Your LetterInventory class should. . .

• Store the inventory (how many a’s, how many b’s, etc.) as an array with 26 counters (one for each
letter) along with any other data fields you find that you need
• Ignore the case of the letters (e.g., “a” and “A”)
• Ignore non-alphabetic characters (e.g., digits, punctuation, etc.) 
   “26” should only appear once.
• Introduce a class constant for the value 26 to make the class more readable
• Should NOT have any extra public methods or have any extra behavior beyond what this spec describes
